This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of whatever type is available, whom they force to dig warrens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for their gnoll masters.</p>\n<p>Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely.</p>\n<p>During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows.

This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of whatever type is available, whom they force to dig warrens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for their gnoll masters.</p>\n<p>Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely.</p>\n<p>During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"Miracles":{"value":0,"max":0},"Faith":{"value":0,"max":0}},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_hiomm3adpbb","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoid","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary/humanoids/gnoll/gnoll-priest-02.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Gnoll Priest","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/gnoll/priest-02.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"64J6ox4EdPcxNoKW","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"g51OdceqBLOvsYIZ","name":"Unskilled Attempt","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>If a character doesn&rsquo;t have a skill for an action he&rsquo;s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a Wild Die if a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n<p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as performing complex surgery or flying a commercial jet.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"agility","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":4,"modifier":"-2"},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_nsugutrpau","path":"Skills","color":"#8c160f"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-skills.zcn1epcU4FEJGGyI"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/uncertainty.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"LAGjXeGIlviM5MXX","name":"Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of whatever type is available, whom they force to dig warrens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for their gnoll masters.</p>\n<p>Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely.</p>\n<p>During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_hiomm3adpbb","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoid","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary/humanoids/gnoll/gnoll-warrior-01.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Gnoll","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/gnoll/warrior-01.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"KW59kdyzCqp9EACy","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"g51OdceqBLOvsYIZ","name":"Unskilled Attempt","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>If a character doesn&rsquo;t have a skill for an action he&rsquo;s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a Wild Die if a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n<p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as performing complex surgery or flying a commercial jet.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"agility","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":4,"modifier":"-2"},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_nsugutrpau","path":"Skills","color":"#8c160f"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-skills.zcn1epcU4FEJGGyI"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/uncertainty.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"LAGjXeGIlviM5MXX","name":"Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation.

All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation.

They live their lives how they wish, and the stereotypes put on them are a just a way for people to give hate to their fear. They waste no time on such people. By that same token, they rarely form opinions about people they know until they spend a lot of time with them, learning as much as possible. They are not casual with the word \"friend\", but their definition of such a word is often crude and difficult for non-goblinoids to understand.</p>\n<p>Goblins in cities, though thick-skinned, are often shy and reserved.

Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands.</p>\n<p>Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely.</p>\n<p>During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"core":{"sheetClass":""},"cf":{"id":"temp_hiomm3adpbb","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Humanoid","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary/humanoids/gnoll/gnoll-warrior-02.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Gnoll","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary_tokens/humanoids/gnoll/warrior-02.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"jwBly38Yy5tfZgha","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"g51OdceqBLOvsYIZ","name":"Unskilled Attempt","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>If a character doesn&rsquo;t have a skill for an action he&rsquo;s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a Wild Die if a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n<p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as performing complex surgery or flying a commercial jet.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"agility","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":4,"modifier":"-2"},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_nsugutrpau","path":"Skills","color":"#8c160f"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-skills.zcn1epcU4FEJGGyI"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/uncertainty.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"LAGjXeGIlviM5MXX","name":"Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

Scorned by the civilized races centuries ago and born from a deific curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and devoured lesser humanoids in retribution for real or imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord named Baphomet.</p>\n<p>The traditional minotaur's lair is a maze, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baffle and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals.</p>\n<p>Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually this means guarding some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master.</p>\n<p>Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living creature when combat begins.</p>\n</div>"},"species":{"name":""},"currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":true,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_uyf2d3np43a","path":"Savage Eberron Bestiary#/CF_SEP/Monstrosity","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary/monstrostities/minotaur-03.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Minotaur","displayName":0,"img":"modules/savage-eberron-bestiary/assets/bestiary_tokens/monstrosities/minotaur-*.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"vf7rTTciJMA7vQSB","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"qFErvovMDx3Mda8C","name":"Horns","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>See @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary-abilities.Natural Weapons]{Natural Weapons} and Gore.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":false,"equipped":true,"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str+d6","range":"","rof":"1","ap":"0","minStr":"","shots":"0","currentShots":"0","ammo":"","autoReload":false},"sort":1200000,"flags":{},"img":"modules/game-icons-net/blackbackground/bull-horns.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"9Si3B4wEQc22znrD","name":"Axe, Battle","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":4,"price":10,"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str+d8","range":"","rof":"1","ap":"0","minStr":"d8","shots":"0","currentShots":"0","ammo":"","autoReload":false},"sort":1300000,"flags":{"journal-links":{},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.6acTa55QfLHmAH5K"},"cf":{"id":"temp_qdamqryz2de","path":"Savage Eberron Equipment#/CF_SEP/Meleee Weapons#/CF_SEP/Martial Weapons","color":"#000000"}},"img":"modules/game-icons-net/blackbackground/battle-axe.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"0NrNcZzyhhBX3zTW","name":"Athletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.
